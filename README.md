Welcome to the simple keylogger repo! A keylogger is a program that records your keystrokes, and this program saves them in a log file on your local computer.

Check out below to learn how to install them. These keyloggers are simple and bare bones, however they work great! Feel free to fork and improve it if you want. Be sure to check out the [issues](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger/pulls) to see if your problem has been fixed, or to help out others.

Currently, there are three keylogger programs for the major operating systems; Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Contents
- [Windows installation guide](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger/blob/master/windows/README.md)
- [Mac installation guide](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger/blob/master/mac/README.md)
- [Linux installation guide](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger/blob/master/linux/README.md)
- [Check out the site for more information](https://simple-keylogger.github.io/)

Or, view the `README.md` file in each programs folder for more up to date information.

## Windows
To change visibility of the window set the `#define` in line 9 to `visible` or `invisible`.

Simply compile into an .exe, and then run. Visual Studio is good for this.

- `invisible` makes the window of the logger disappear, and it also starts up hidden from view. Note that it is still visible in the task manager.
- `visible` is visible, and the window does not close when typing. Great for testing it out.

Both of these save the keystrokes to a .txt file when closed.

> Note that sometimes your compiler may through up errors. If it does, keep compiling - the program still works. As always, please create an issue if you have a problem.

## Mac
This is a little more complicated. Please note, it does not work for secure areas such as password inputs. I have not found a work around yet.

### Installation
Download the repo. It will install in `/usr/local/bin/keylogger`.

Install it:

`$ git clone https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger && cd Keylogger/mac`

`$ make && make install`

It will log to `/var/log/keystroke.log`. This may require root access, but you can change that if you want. Set where you want it to log:

`$ keylogger ~/logfile.txt`

`Logging to: /var/log/keystroke.log`

Want to make it start on system startup?

`$ sudo make startup`

That will run it on startup.

### Uninstall
`$ sudo make uninstall`

Will uninstall the program, but not the logs.

Thanks to [Casey Scarborough](https://github.com/caseyscarborough/keylogger) for the base program!

> Please note that this logger cannot record keystrokes in protected areas yet.

## Linux

### Installation


The following instructions will install Keylogger using pip3 .

```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
or 
```
  pip3 install pyxhook
```

## How to run it

By running `nohup python3 keylogger.py &` command, it'll start to log your strokes:
The meaning of nohup is ‘no hangup‘.
When nohup command use with ‘&’ then it doesn’t return to shell command prompt after running the command in the background. 
```
$~/Keylogger/linux$ nohup python3 keylogger.py &
[1] 12529 //this is the keylogger's PID (process ID)
$:~/Keylogger/linux$ fg

```

The Keylogger is now running! It will log your strokes to a file .
Stop it by typing the command `fg` then hitting `CTRL+C`

or

`kill {PID}` for example `kill 12529`
