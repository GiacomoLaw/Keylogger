## Windows
To change visibility of the window set the `#define` in line 6 to `visible` or `invisible`.

Simply compile into an .exe, and then run. Visual Studio is good for this.

- `invisible` makes the window of the logger disappear, and it also starts up hidden from view. Note that it is still visible in the task manager.
- `visible` is visible, and the window does not close when typing. Great for testing it out.

Both of these save the keystrokes to a .txt file when closed.
